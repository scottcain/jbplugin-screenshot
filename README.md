#Screen Shot Plugin

This is a JBrowse plugin
 
This plugin allows the user to take a high quality screenshot of the browser.
This plugin leverages the power of PhantomJS to create an image of the browser. Unfortunately, images are created using only the backend track settings so changes made within the browser interface will not included in the screenshot.

##Special Thanks
This plugin would not be possible without [phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), specifically [PhantomJS Cloud](https://phantomjscloud.com/), which provides phantomJS as a headless software-as-a-service. 


##Install

For JBrowse 1.11.6+ in the _JBrowse/plugins_ folder, type:  
`git clone https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-screenshot.git ScreenShotPlugin`

**or**

downloaded the latest release version at [releases](https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-screenshot/releases).  
Unzip the downloaded folder, place in _JBrowse/plugins_, and rename the folder _ScreenShotPlugin_

##Activate

Add this to _jbrowse.conf_ under `[GENERAL]`:
```
    [plugins.ScreenShotPlugin]
    location = plugins/ScreenShotPlugin
```

If that doesn't work, add this to _jbrowse_conf.json_:
```
    "plugins" : {
        "ScreenShotPlugin" : { "location" : "plugins/ScreenShotPlugin" }
}
```

###PhantomJS Cloud Accounts
This plugin will work directly out of the box with PhantomJS Cloud. PhantomJS Clous offers a "demo" version of its services where each IP address is limited to 100 requests per day.
If this is insufficient, you can create a free account with PhantomJS Cloud which allows 500 requests per day to that account. See [PhantomJS Cloud](https://phantomjscloud.com/pricing.html) for more information.

If you do have your own account with PhantomJS, include your user API key when activating the plugin.

For _jbrowse.conf_
```
    [plugins.ScreenShotPlugin]
    location = plugins/ScreenShotPlugin
    apiKey = <insert_api_key>
```
For _jbrowse_conf.json_
```
    "plugins" : {
        "ScreenShotPlugin" : { "location" : "plugins/ScreenShotPlugin",
                            "apiKey": "<insert_api_key>" }
    }
```
    
##Use
Click the "Screen shot" button in the browser. A dialog box will open with options for the screenshot. You can also press the `s` key as a shortcut to open the dialog box.

When increasing the zoom factor, you will likely need to increase the height and width to ensure a full image.

When selecting the PDF output, you must choose a page size (A3, A4, A5, letter, legal, or tabloid) and orientation (landscape or portrait). 
The height and width parameters do not specify output page size. Now they specificy the "viewport" (portion of screen to be printed) of the image to be placed on the output page. This may require some trial and error to get the best view.  
Also, the tracklist does not always display well when using PDF output. When selecting the PDF output option, it will automatically uncheck "Show tracklist".

**Note:** Due to the nature of URL-encoded screenshots, default track configurations will be used unless overriden by settings selected in this dialog box. Locally added tracks, such as combination tracks, will not be included.

##Alternate PhantomJS Servers

If you would like to avoid using PhantomJSCloud, you can provide a Manet (https://github.com/vbauer/manet) server instance instead.  Manet is an open source software project that provides a web interface to PhantomJS that is similar to (though not as full featured as) PhantomJSCloud.  You can either install Manet from source or via a Docker container (e.g. https://github.com/pdelsante/manet-dockerfile).  If you deploy Manet, you will definitely want to look at the "whitelist" option, that restricts what pages it will make screenshots of (you don't want to make a service available that will allow any page on the internet to be screenshotted!).  After installing and configuring Manet, you only need to provide a "customURL" option in the JBrowse configuration, like this:

For _jbrowse.conf_
```
    [plugins.ScreenShotPlugin]
    location = plugins/ScreenShotPlugin
    customURL = <insert_api_key>
```
For _jbrowse_conf.json_
```
    "plugins" : {
        "ScreenShotPlugin" : { "location" : "plugins/ScreenShotPlugin",
                            "customURL": "<insert_api_key>" }
    }
```

Note that if you supply both ```customURL``` and ```apiKey``` in the configuration, ```apiKey``` will be ignored.

##Support for Additional Plugins
###Methylation Plugin
This plugin includes support for the [MethylationPlugin](https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-methylation).  
If the plugin ID<sup>1</sup> is anything except `MethylationPlugin`, the ID will need to be specified. 

For _jbrowse.conf_
```
    [plugins.ScreenShotPlugin]
    ...
    methylPlugin = <methylation_plugin_id>
```

###Small RNA Plugin
This plugin includes support for the [SmallRNAPlugin](https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-smallrna).  
If the plugin ID<sup>1</sup> is anything except `SmallRNAPlugin`, the ID will need to be specified. 

For _jbrowse.conf_
```
    [plugins.ScreenShotPlugin]
    ...
    smrnaPlugin = <smallrna_plugin_id>
```

<sup>1</sup>For jbrowse.conf, the plugin ID is found as `[plugins.ID]` for each plugin.  
In jbrowse_conf.json, the plugin ID is found as `"plugins":{"ID":{"location":"..."}}`

###SeqViewsPlugin
This plugin only needs to know if the [SeqViewsPlugin](https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-seqview) is activated.

It will automatically look for a plugin with the plugin ID `SeqViewsPlugin`. If the SeqViews Plugin has been activate but with a different plugin ID, indicate that `seqViewsPlugin = true`.

In _jbrowse.conf_,
```
    [plugins.ScreenShotPlugin]
    ...
    seqViewsPlugin = true
```

Optionally, you can specify `seqViewsPlugin = false` if you do not want to include support for it.

##Future Improvements
- Hide track labels
- Convert canvas features to HTML features for better SVG editting
